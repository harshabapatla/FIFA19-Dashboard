# FIFA19-Dashboard
This dashboard visualizes the FIFA 19 information of around 17000 players 
that is visually appealing that can view and help understand a particular 
player gameplay using Bokeh and Tableau.
Analyzed the complex FIFA 19 dataset, identified trends, and applied statistical techniques 
as a part of data analysis to uncover patterns and correlations in the dataset.
Using Python and its libraries like pandas, Matplotlib and Bokeh, 
we have performed Data Manipulation for creating visualizations 
and other transformation tasks are done by applying calculated fields.
